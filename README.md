# UniStuff
my uni coding lies here. nothing too exciting, just mainly for backup.
I will tweak this here and there, whenever I feel like it. 

most of these are about TUI applications. if you want, feel free to use all of this here! 
note that everything is in a language and a language alone. (again, might change them to add .txt for example)
