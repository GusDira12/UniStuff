# everything uni
here's my uni coding! from normal assignments to competitive programming related.
I will tweak the code here and there, whenever I feel like it.

what's in here? java, c++, and uh, python maybe?

if you want, feel free to use all of this here!
note that everything is in a language and a language alone. (again, might change them to add .txt for example)
